## 🔍 Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Database Schema Foreign Key Constraint**
   - **Issue**: Booking model had incorrect User relation causing constraint violations
   - **Fix**: Removed conflicting relation and updated schema
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

2. **Student Profile Auto-Creation**
   - **Issue**: Students without profiles couldn't book classes
   - **Fix**: Added automatic profile creation in all student endpoints
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

3. **Teacher Availability Management**
   - **Issue**: Time slots weren't saving immediately to database
   - **Fix**: Updated to save instantly instead of requiring separate save action
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

4. **Admin Stats Schema Issues**
   - **Issue**: Referenced non-existent relations (`studentBookings`, `teacherBookings`)
   - **Fix**: Updated to use correct `bookings` relation
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

5. **Database Seed Script**
   - **Issue**: Unique constraint violations on availability slots
   - **Fix**: Updated to use `upsert` operations instead of `createMany`
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

6. **Time Comparison Logic**
   - **Issue**: Incorrect timestamp comparisons in booking validation
   - **Fix**: Updated time comparison logic to handle Date objects properly
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved
